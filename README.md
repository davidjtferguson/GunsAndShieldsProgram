About:

Guns and Shields! Shoot your opponent off the stage! The more you shoot them the further they fly. However, if you shoot their shield your attack will do nothing.

Each player's gun and shield has two positions: high gun, low shield and low gun, high shield. This means that you can only shoot the other opponent when you are vulnerable. Trick your opponent on holding their shield one way, and fire a bullet the other!

Make sure to fight for stage control - the closer to the centre of the stage you are the better! If you jump on your opponent you can push them back. If you're cornered at the edge of the stage you could also jump over them! Watch out though - you can't shoot in the air.
